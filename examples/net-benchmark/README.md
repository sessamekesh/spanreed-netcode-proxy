# Net Benchmark

Benchmark tool that demonstrates two things:

1. How to use Spanreed as a library in a custom proxy
2. Using custom message exchange formats

It's also useful for collecting some benchmarks around CPU+memory use under certian network conditions, packet loss, RTT between client <-> proxy and proxy <-> destination, and to form comparisons to client <-> destination direct WebSocket connections.
